To run pointird on windows, run PointIR.bat.
This will also start a dbus daemon that is used by the calibration utility.

If you have more than one webcam attached it may be necessary to edit PointIR.bat.
For example append "-d 1" to the command line to use the second camera.
More available options can be viewed by executing "pointird --help".
