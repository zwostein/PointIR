What is PointIR?
================

PointIR is an alternative input method for computers connected to large-area displays like projectors.
For example, a presentation stick can be used to directly interact with the projected computer screen.
An infra-red marker would be attached to the tip of the stick, so a camera can be used to localize the stick's tip on the screen.
PointIR will translate all visible markers on the screen to multi-touch events and inject them to the operating system.
